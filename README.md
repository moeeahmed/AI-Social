## API Usage

### Instagram API

The Instagram Basic Display API has been deprecated, so you need to use the Instagram Graph API going forward. To use the API, follow these steps:

1. **Create an App:** Create an app on the Facebook Developer portal.
2. **Link Instagram Account:** Link your Instagram account to your app by setting up Instagram business login.
3. **Generate an Access Token:** Generate an access token and securely store it. This token will be required to make API requests.
4. **Send GET Requests:** Use GET requests to access data via various endpoints. For example:
```curl
curl -i -X GET \
"https://graph.instagram.com/v21.0/me?fields=user_id,username&access_token=Ealkdfj..."
```
### Facebook API

In addition to the Instagram API, you may need to use the Facebook Graph API. Here are the steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Facebook Business Page:** Ensure you have a Facebook Business Page linked to an Instagram Business or Creator account. The Facebook Page must have admin rights to enable the necessary API integrations.
2. **Create a Developer Account:** Use the Facebook Page to create a developer account on the Facebook Developer portal.
3. **Generate an Access Token:** Generate an access token with the required permissions (e.g., pages_read_engagement, instagram_basic, instagram_manage_insights). Make sure to securely store the access token for use in API requests.
4. **Set Up App Permissions:** Ensure your app has the necessary permissions approved for the actions you intend to perform. For example, you may need pages_read_engagement for Facebook Page data or instagram_basic for Instagram account details.
5. **Send API Requests:** Use the access token to make requests to Facebook Graph API endpoints. For example:
```curl
curl -i -X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/v21.0/{page_id}/insights?metric=page_impressions&access_token={access_token}"
```
### Additional Notes

**Limited API Access:** Until your app has advanced access, the number of endpoints available may be limited.

**Testing Limitations:** The option to add 'test users' may not be available, so testing some endpoints might require leveraging the Facebook API instead.

**Access Reviews:** If your app requires advanced access, you will need to submit it for review by Facebook to ensure compliance with their policies.

## API Calls
